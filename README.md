This project replicates the Tic tac toe game. <br/>
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. If at any moment, a player succeds to form a line of his mark, he wins the game.
If no player wins and the grid is filled completely, the result is draw.<br/>
You can find an in-depth explanation of how I create the project in this video: https://www.loom.com/share/f7d10cdd32234bcda1af8651f293c8e0
